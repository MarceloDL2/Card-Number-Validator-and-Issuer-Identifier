# Card Number Validator and Issuer Identifier
 This script validates a credit or debit card number using the Luhn algorithm. It also identifies the card's issuing company (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.) based on its initial digits. The user inputs a card number, and the script checks if it's mathematically valid and displays the corresponding issuer.
